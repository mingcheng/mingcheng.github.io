# 👋 Hello, I'm mingcheng.

It is extremely stressful for me to have to reintroduce myself each time I participate in community events. So, I created this page to tell you more about me.

## 🏠 Essential Information

I was raised in Ningbo, which is a small city in the east of mainland China. I graduated from [Zhejiang University of Science and Technology(ZUST)](https://en.zust.edu.cn) in 2008, and I am currently pursuing studies at [Shanghai International Studies University (SISU)](https://en.shisu.edu.cn).

I am a PPMC & Committer at the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) and an open-source evangelist working for the [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup).

I formerly worked for companies and teams including `Alibaba (Taobao)`, `NetEase`, and `Sifou` as a developer, architect, technical lecturer, technical lead and general manager.

I use Golang, Java, Typescript, Python, PHP, and other tech stacks in my many years of programming and architecture work. I'm currently learning Rust and the Zig language.

I also have deep experience in the management of technical teams, the development of open source projects, and the promotion of technical communities.
